# 12 - probe matrix

- **Issue:** #879   **Phase:** P0 discovery   **Date (UTC):** 2026-06-29   **Vault/panel:** physical Calyx vaults with persisted search indexes
- **Goal:** run a reusable physical probe matrix over fusion x phrasing x length x lens emphasis, persist the complete matrix as a source-of-truth artifact, and log combinations that surface unique grounded hits.

## Root cause
The previous #879 slice only proved the Lodestar in-memory planner. It did not provide a physical CLI harness that opened a real vault, measured real selected lenses, searched the persisted index, and wrote a durable readback artifact.

While wiring the physical harness, three related root causes showed up:

- Weighted-RRF profiles and explicit single-lens slots were not expressible through the physical search API, so matrix rows could not preserve their exact fusion intent.
- Search measurement and persisted-index boundedness checks were global to all active slots. A scoped probe could be blocked by unrelated active slots and sidecars.
- The anchored large corpus has two separate defects outside #879: a corrupted slot-15 frozen registry contract (#1000) and excessive large-corpus matrix materialization/search state (#1001).

## Research used
Best-practice research was done with Exa plus browser search before implementation.

- Cormack, Clarke, and Buettcher, SIGIR 2009, "Reciprocal Rank Fusion outperforms Condorcet and individual rank learning methods." This supports keeping RRF-style rank evidence explainable per contributing run.
- Azure AI Search hybrid/RRF docs:
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-ranking
- Elastic search/retriever docs:
  - https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/v9/operation/operation-search

Implementation choices taken from that research:

- Preserve exact source provenance for every fusion row: fusion mode, selected RRF profile, selected slot, rank, ledger sequence, ledger hash, and per-lens contribution.
- Fail closed when a selected target is unavailable instead of silently broadening the query.
- Scope selected fields/slots explicitly so a targeted probe matrix does not measure unrelated active lenses.
- Persist a durable matrix artifact and independently read it back instead of treating command success as proof.

## What changed
Implemented a physical `calyx probe-matrix <vault>` command:

- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/probe_matrix.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/probe_matrix/parse.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/probe_matrix/tests.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/mod.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/tests.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/cmd/tests/token_roundtrip.rs`
- `crates/calyx-cli/src/usage.rs`
- `crates/calyx-search/src/engine.rs`
- `crates/calyx-search/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/calyx-search/src/persisted.rs`
- `crates/calyx-search/src/persisted/mixed_tests.rs`

The command now:

- Opens a real Calyx vault and persisted panel/registry.
- Validates requested slots are present, active, and text modality.
- Runs the probe matrix through physical search with explicit slot scoping.
- Preserves `WeightedRrfProfile(profile)` and `SingleLensSlot(slot)` fusion choices.
- Writes `<vault>/idx/probe_matrix/<blake3>/matrix.json` with an atomic write, byte readback, JSON decode, and SHA256 report.
- Fails closed if the matrix has no records, no grounded accepted hits, or no productive rows.

## Local verification
Commands run on the authoring checkout:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
git diff --check
cargo test -p calyx-search boundedness_check_is_scoped_to_selected_slots --target-dir target/issue879-search --jobs 32 -- --nocapture
cargo test -p calyx-search explicit_fusion_choices_preserve_profile_and_slot --target-dir target/issue879-search --jobs 32 -- --nocapture
cargo test -p calyx-cli cmd::probe_matrix::tests --target-dir target/issue879-cli-probe --jobs 32 -- --nocapture
cargo test -p calyx-lodestar --test issue879_probe_matrix_tests --target-dir target/issue879-lodestar --jobs 32 -- --nocapture
cargo test -p calyx-cli vault_subcommands_round_trip --target-dir target/issue879-cli-roundtrip --jobs 32 -- --nocapture
```

Focused tests prove:

- Probe-matrix command parsing and token round trips.
- Source-of-truth matrix persistence and readback.
- Missing slots fail before artifact creation.
- Explicit weighted-RRF profiles and single-lens slots preserve exact search intent.
- Boundedness checks are scoped to selected slots and fail closed when the selected sidecar is corrupt.

## Boundary and edge case audit
Source of truth for edge cases: artifact count under the vault's `idx/probe_matrix`.

```json
{
  "cases": [
    {
      "case": "empty_frontier",
      "before": {"artifact_count": 1},
      "after": {"artifact_count": 1, "exit": 2},
      "error": "CALYX_CLI_USAGE_ERROR: probe-matrix requires non-empty --frontier <text>"
    },
    {
      "case": "missing_slot",
      "before": {"artifact_count": 1},
      "after": {"artifact_count": 1, "exit": 2},
      "error": "CALYX_CLI_USAGE_ERROR: --slot 123 is not present in the vault panel"
    },
    {
      "case": "zero_top_k",
      "before": {"artifact_count": 1},
      "after": {"artifact_count": 1, "exit": 2},
      "error": "CALYX_CLI_USAGE_ERROR: --top-k must be >= 1"
    }
  ]
}
```

All three edge cases failed closed and did not create or modify a matrix artifact.

## Anchored-corpus findings
Attempts against `corpus-anchored-869-20260625T080546Z` exposed two separate P0 defects:

- #1000: slot 15 has a persisted frozen-contract mismatch. The active slot stores lens id `6f47e637a0c287f78972af35c369ce82`, but reconstructing the registry spec yields `51349ee0af01f5257a648c5ac60a9246`.
- #1001: even after scoped slot selection, large-corpus probe-matrix runs can materialize too much provenance/search state. One selected two-slot run reached about 41 GB RSS and ran more than 11 minutes before artifact creation.

Those blockers are not hidden by #879. The probe matrix harness is complete and verified on a real physical vault; #1000 and #1001 track the remaining corpus-specific failures.

## Conclusion
#879 is complete for the physical probe-matrix harness. The command now runs against real vault state, persists a durable matrix artifact, records productive combinations with grounded provenance, and fails closed on invalid or unproductive states. Large-corpus repair and scaling continue under #1000 and #1001.
